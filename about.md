`eda` is a Stata package for automating a fair amount of [exploratory data analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-John-Tukey/dp/0201076160) tasks.  The program allows users to select specific graph types to exclude (or generates all by default) and creates univariate and bivariate graphs and tables for the data in the dataset loaded in memory or referenced with the `using` syntax.
